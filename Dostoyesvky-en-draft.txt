00:14
outskirts of Moscow his family were
00:16
comfortably off his father was a
00:18
successful doctor though he happened to
00:20
work at a charitable hospital that
00:21
provided medical services for the very
00:23
poor the family had a house in the
00:26
hospital complex so the young
00:27
Dostoyevsky was from the very beginning
00:29
powerfully exposed to experiences from
00:32
which other children of his background
00:33
were usually carefully sheltered like
00:36
almost everyone in Tsarist Russia his
00:38
parents were devout Orthodox Christians
00:40
and Dostoevsky's own religious faith got
00:43
deeper and stronger throughout his life
00:45
at the age of 12 he was sent away to
00:48
school first in Moscow and later in the
00:50
capital sin Petersburg he got a good
00:52
education there was a child of the tiny
00:54
professional middle class he felt out of
00:56
place among his more aristocratic
00:58
classmates while he was away at school
01:01
his father died possibly murdered by his
01:04
own serfs after graduating Dostoevsky
01:07
worked as an engineer for a while he
01:09
started gambling and losing money
01:11
something that was to play him all his
01:12
life in his late 20s he became friends
01:15
with a group of radical writers and
01:17
intellectuals he wasn't deeply involved
01:19
but when the government decided to
01:20
crackdown on dissent Dostoevsky was
01:23
rounded up too and sentenced to be shot
01:25
by a firing squad however at the last
01:28
moment just when the soldiers were ready
01:30
to fire a message of reprieve arrived
01:33
Dostoevsky was sent instead to Siberia
01:35
for four years of forced labour in
01:38
horrific conditions it was only after
01:41
his return from Siberia the Dostoevsky
01:43
established himself as a writer starting
01:46
in middle aged he produced a series of
01:48
major books notes from the underground
01:50
crime and punishment the idiot
01:53
demons and the Brothers Karamazov they
01:56
are dark violent and tragic and usually
01:58
very long and complicated he wrote them
02:00
to preach five important lessons to the
02:03
world incidentally the discussion of
02:05
Dostoyevsky's ideas does involve
02:07
revealing the plots of some of his
02:08
novels it's not something that would
02:10
have worried him because his books are
02:12
written to be read more than
02:13
once but if it bothers you this is the
02:16
place to break off dosa yes Keys first
02:18
big book notes from the underground is
02:20
an extended rant against life and the
02:23
world delivered by a retired civil
02:25
servant the civil servant is deeply
02:28
unreasonable inconsistent and furious
02:30
with everyone including himself he's
02:33
always getting into rouse he goes to a
02:35
reunion of some former colleagues and
02:36
tells them all how much he's always
02:38
hated them he wants to puncture
02:40
everyone's illusions and make them as
02:42
unhappy as he is he seems like a great
02:45
esque character to build a book around
02:47
but he's doing something important he's
02:49
insisting with a peculiar kind of
02:51
intensity on a very strange fact about
02:54
the human condition we want happiness
02:56
but we have a special talent for making
02:59
ourselves miserable man is sometimes
03:02
extraordinarily passionately in love
03:04
with suffering that is a fact he asserts
03:08
in the novel Dostoevsky is taking aim at
03:11
philosophies of progress and improvement
03:13
which were highly popular in his age as
03:15
they continue to be in ours he is
03:18
attacking our habit of telling ourselves
03:20
that if only this that thing were
03:22
different we could leave suffering
03:24
behind if we got that great job changed
03:26
the government could afford that great
03:28
house invented a machine to fly fast
03:30
around the world could get together with
03:32
or divorce from a particular person then
03:35
all would go well this Dostoyevsky
03:38
argues is a delusion suffering will
03:41
always pursue us schemes for improving
03:43
the world always contain a flaw they
03:46
won't eliminate suffering they will only
03:48
change the things that causes pain life
03:51
can only ever be a process of changing
03:53
the focus of pain never of removing pain
03:57
itself there will always be something to
03:59
agonize us stop people starving says
04:02
Dostoevsky with calculated wickedness
04:04
and you'll soon find there's a new range
04:06
of Agony's people will start to suffer
04:08
from boredom greed or intense melancholy
04:11
that they haven't been invited to the
04:13
right party in this spirit notes from
04:16
the underground launches an attack on
04:17
all ideologies of technical or social
04:20
progress which aspire to the elimination
04:22
of suffering but they won't succeed
04:24
because as soon as they solve one
04:26
problem
04:26
they'll direct our nature to become
04:28
unhappy in new ways Dostoevsky is
04:31
fascinated by the secret way in which we
04:33
actually don't want what we
04:35
theoretically seem to seek he discusses
04:37
the pleasure a lot of people get from
04:39
feelings of superiority and for whom
04:41
consequently an egalitarian society
04:44
would be a nightmare or the disavowed
04:47
but real thrill we get from hearing
04:49
about violent crimes on the news in
04:51
which case we'd actually feel thought it
04:53
in a truly peaceful world
04:55
notes from the underground is a dark
04:58
awkwardly insightful counterpoint to
05:00
well-intentioned modern liberalism it
05:03
doesn't really show that social
05:04
improvement is meaningless but it does
05:06
remind us that we'll always carry a very
05:09
complex and difficult selves with us and
05:11
that progress will never be as clear and
05:14
clean as we might like to imagine in
05:17
crime and punishment we meet an
05:19
impoverished intellectual Rodion
05:21
Raskolnikov though he's currently a
05:24
nobody he's fascinated by power and
05:26
ruthlessness he thinks of himself as a
05:29
version of Napoleon leaders of men such
05:31
as Napoleon were all without exception
05:33
criminals we here they broke the ancient
05:36
laws of their people to make new ones
05:38
that suited them better and they never
05:40
feared bloodshed Raskolnikov is also
05:44
desperate for money and so aristocratic
05:46
superiority in mind he decides to murder
05:49
an old woman who's a small-time
05:51
pawnbroker in moneylender and to steal
05:54
her cash he's tormented by the mad
05:56
injustice of the fact that this horrible
05:58
mean old character has drawers full of
06:00
rubles while he who is clever energetic
06:03
and profound is starving he doesn't
06:06
spend much time thinking about options
06:07
like taking a job as a waiter so
06:10
Raskolnikov breaks into her apartment
06:12
and bludgeoned her to death and
06:13
surprised in the act by the woman's
06:15
pregnant half-sister kills her too but
06:18
it turns out he's nothing like the
06:20
cold-blooded rational hero of his own
06:22
imagination he is tormented by guilt and
06:25
horror at what he has done eventually he
06:28
turns himself over to the police in
06:30
order to face the proper punishment for
06:32
his crime we're probably never going to
06:34
do what Raskolnikov did but we often
06:37
share a troubling tendency with him
06:39
we think we know ourselves better than
06:41
we actually do Raskolnikov thinks he's
06:44
ruthless actually he's rather
06:46
tender-hearted he thinks he won't feel
06:48
guilt but he's overwhelmed by remorse
06:51
part of our life's journey is to engage
06:53
in a tricky task of disentangling
06:55
ourselves from what we think were like
06:58
in order to discover our true nature
07:00
Raskolnikov is especially fascinating
07:03
because of the direction this
07:04
self-discovery takes his striking
07:07
realization is that he's actually a much
07:09
nicer person than he takes himself to be
07:12
whereas so many novelists the light in
07:15
showing the sickly reality Beneatha
07:17
glamorous or enticing facade Dostoevsky
07:20
is embarked on a more curious but
07:22
rewarding mission he wants to reveal
07:24
that beneath the so-called monster there
07:26
can very often be a far more interesting
07:28
tender-hearted character lurking a nice
07:31
but deluded intelligent but frightened
07:34
and panicked person sticking for the
07:37
moment with crime and punishment it's
07:39
very significant the way Dostoevsky gets
07:41
us to like his murderous hero
07:44
Raskolnikov is clearly an attractive
07:46
person at the very start of the book
07:48
we're told by the way Raskolnikov is
07:51
handsome above the average in height
07:53
slim well-built with lovely dark eyes
07:55
and dark brown hair
07:57
Dostoevsky throughout lessens the
07:59
imaginative distance between us who live
08:01
mainly law-abiding and more or less
08:03
manageable lives and them the ones who
08:06
do terrible things and wreak havoc with
08:09
their lives and those of others that
08:11
person he is saying is more like you
08:13
than you might initially want to think
08:15
and therefore more accessible to
08:18
sympathy the idea that you can be a good
08:21
person do something very bad and still
08:23
deserve some compassion sounds may be
08:26
slight and obvious until one has need of
08:29
this kind of forgiveness in one's own
08:30
life this is where Dostoevsky wants to
08:33
enter our inner conversation with
08:35
ourselves and tell us all about his
08:37
character Raskolnikov a serious
08:39
thoughtful good-looking man who did
08:41
worse than we have and still can be
08:44
compassionately understood as we can and
08:46
must all be this is Dostoyevsky's
08:49
Christianity at work no one is outside
08:52
the circle of
08:53
God's love and understanding
08:55
Dostoyevsky's next great book the idiot
08:58
takes off from his near-death experience
09:00
before the firing squad in the novel he
09:03
recounts what that was like three
09:05
minutes before his expected death he is
09:08
able to see life clearly for the first
09:09
time he notices the gilded spire of a
09:13
nearby church and how it glitters in the
09:15
Sun he'd never before realized how
09:17
entrancing a glint of sunlight could be
09:19
he is filled with an immense deep love
09:22
of the world you might see a beggar and
09:24
think how you would love to change
09:26
places with them so as to be able to
09:28
continue to breathe the air and feel the
09:30
wind merely to exist seems at that
09:33
moment of final revelation infinitely
09:36
precious and then the revised order
09:39
comes and it's not over at all what
09:42
would it be like to go through one's
09:43
whole life in such a state of gratitude
09:45
and generosity you wouldn't share any of
09:48
the normal attitudes you'd love everyone
09:51
equally you'd be enchanted by the
09:52
simplest things you never feel angry or
09:55
frightened you would seem to other
09:57
people to be a kind of idiot hence the
10:00
title of Dostoyevsky's book it's an
10:03
extreme version of a very interesting
10:04
step we're continually surrounded by
10:07
things which could delight us if only we
10:09
saw them in the right way if only we
10:12
could learn to appreciate them
10:13
Dostoevsky was desperate to communicate
10:16
the value of existence before death
10:18
would overtake him and us in
10:20
Dostoyevsky's final great work Brothers
10:23
Karamazov
10:24
which came out when he was nearly sixty
10:25
one of the central characters tells a
10:28
long story within a story it's called
10:30
the Grand Inquisitor and imagines that
10:33
the greatest event looked forward to by
10:35
Christian theology the second coming of
10:37
Christ has in fact already happened
10:40
Jesus did come back several hundred
10:43
years ago he turned up in Spain during
10:46
the highest period of power in the
10:47
Catholic Church the organization
10:50
established in theory at least entirely
10:52
in devotion to him Christ is back to
10:55
fulfill his teachings of forgiveness and
10:57
universal love but something rather odd
10:59
happens the most powerful religious
11:02
leader the Grand Inquisitor
11:04
as Jesus arrested and imprisoned in the
11:07
middle of the night the Grand Inquisitor
11:09
visits Christ in his cell and explains
11:11
that he cannot allow him to do his work
11:13
on earth because he is a threat to the
11:15
stability of society Christ he says is
11:19
just too ambitious too pure to perfect
11:21
humanity can't live up to the impossible
11:24
goals he set before us the fact is
11:26
people haven't been able to live
11:28
according to his teachings and Jesus
11:30
should admit he failed and that his
11:32
ideas of redemption were essentially
11:34
misguided the Grand Inquisitor is not
11:37
really a monster in fact Dostoyevsky
11:40
portrays him is quite an admirable
11:41
figure in the story he is a guide to a
11:44
crucial idea that human beings cannot
11:47
live in purity cannot ever be just truly
11:50
good cannot live up to Christ's message
11:53
and that this is something we should
11:55
reconcile ourselves to with grace rather
11:58
than fury or self-hatred we have to
12:00
accept a great deal of unreasonableness
12:02
folly greed selfishness and
12:05
shortsightedness as in eradicable parts
12:07
of the human condition and plan
12:09
accordingly and it's not just a
12:12
pessimistic thesis about politics or
12:14
religion that we're being introduced to
12:16
the primary relevance of this thesis is
12:18
as a commentary on our own lives we
12:21
won't sort them out we won't stop being
12:23
a bit mad and wayward and we shouldn't
12:25
torment ourselves with a dream that we
12:27
could if only we tried hard enough
12:29
become the perfect beings that
12:31
idealistic philosophies like
12:33
Christianity like to sketch all too
12:35
readily Dostoevsky died in 1881 he had a
12:39
very hard life but he succeeded in
12:42
conveying an idea which perhaps he
12:44
understood more clearly than anyone in a
12:47
world that's very keen on upbeat stories
12:49
we will always run up against our
12:51
limitations as deeply flawed and
12:53
profoundly muddled creatures
12:55
Dostoevsky's attitude bleak but
12:58
compassionate tragic but kind is needed
13:01
more than ever in our naive and
13:03
sentimental age that so fervently clings
13:06
to the idea which this great Russian
13:08
novelist loathed that science can save
13:10
us all and that we may yet be made
13:12
perfect through technology Dostoevsky
13:14
guides us to a more humane darker truth
13:17
that as the great sages have always
13:19
known life is and ever will be suffering
13:23
and yet that there is great redemption
13:25
available in articulating this message
13:27
in brilliant and moving complex and
13:31
subtle works of art
13:39
you
